Reading Tracker


By: Kenzin Igor

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`books.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`books_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.


1. How long did the entire project  take you?
> It took me about 2 weeks to finish this assignment. This productive work helped me finish ahead of the deadline for the project and I allowed me to look at my mistakes over time.


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for ?
> I also intend to start developing this project earlier, because it will allow me to better prepare my questions for the teacher so that I can ask the question correctly and get the answer I need.
